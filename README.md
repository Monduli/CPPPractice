# CPPPractice
Practice C++ project.  
  
Haven't decided what to do with this C++ project yet as I am learning the language.  
Ideally what I would like to make for practice is a game where you take care of ducks of different colors, and you can swap it into tower defense mode where your ducks are your towers.  
Raising ducks a particular way would contribute to their statistics in the tower defense mode.  
Ideally, I should make something cybersecurity related, though, so it might become that too.

Added some more practice lines.  
Haven't given enough thought to what I want to make yet, but I still have a good amount of tutorial to go still before that comes around.
