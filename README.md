# CPPPractice
Practice C++ project.

Haven't decided what to do with this C++ project yet as I am learning the language.
Ideally what I would like to make for practice is a game where you take care of ducks of different colors, and you can swap it into tower defense mode where your ducks are your towers.
Raising ducks a particular way would contribute to their statistics in the tower defense mode.
Ideally, I should make something cybersecurity related, though, so it might become that too.
